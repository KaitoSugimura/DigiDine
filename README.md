## Viewing the deployed website

> [!NOTE]  
> Please note this website is intended only to mimic a tablet application.
> You may experience a lack of mouse events or mouse hover actions because of it.
> To simulate a tablet, you may use your browsers development features and set the dimensions to at minimum: 1120 x 720

> [!TIP]
> Depending on your computer/laptops screen resolution, the web application might look too small or too big.
> One way to reoslve this is to use your browsers development features and set the dimensions to the ones specified in the note above and then adjusting the zoom in the tool.
> If you do not want to use the browsers development features, you may simply use your browsers zoom features to zoom in and out (Ctrl + or Ctrl -)
